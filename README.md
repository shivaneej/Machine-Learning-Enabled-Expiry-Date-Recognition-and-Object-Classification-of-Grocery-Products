# Machine Learning-Enabled Expiry Date Recognition and Object Classification of Grocery Products
## CS-7641: Machine Learning - Group 43

## Introduction and Background
Few products can last forever, more so food items. Expiration dates on products serve as an estimate for the healthy usage of the product. It is the date up to which food maintains its biological and physical stability. There are many cases where the information on the product label is hard to read and this is even more true in the case of a visually impaired person. With an increasing need to maintain the food quality standard, this remains an issue which needs to be tackled. 

For the scope of this project, we considered an image data set which has real images of various food, beverage and drugs consisting of 13 different date formats. Moreover, a custom dataset with synthetic images having dates similar to an actual product label is considered for building the model.  


## Problem Definition and Motivation
Many grocery products are similar in shape and texture, making it difficult for visually impaired people to identify them using touch. Also, they cannot read expiry dates of products, necessary to ensure safe consumption. Thus, we aim to create a system providing audio feedback to such people by identifying the grocery product and the best-before/expiry date if mentioned.
